# Scheduling using GPT-4

Exploring if GPT-4 can generate a conference schedule using constraints.  For the moment without success ü•π

I've taken the public available [VoxxedDays Zurich](https://voxxeddays.com/zurich/schedule/) conference schedule details including the accepted talks.

## The constraints

HIGH CONSTRAINTS:

1. Use the talk summary to decide which talks should follow each other 
3. Don't use talks with the same tracks at the same time 
4. A speaker can't speak at different rooms during the same time
5. Only use the listed talks
6. List the talk id, from/to time, room name, title, speaker names, level and track name 

MEDIUM CONSTRAINTS:
1. Use markdown to list the generated schedule

4506;Resumability in the next generation frontend framework With O(1) loading time;BEGINNER;"Qwik is a JavaScript framework that uses a new render paradigm called resumability to serialize JavaScript apps into HTML without the need for the hydration technique used in meta-frameworks like Next.js. It enables us to build ""resumable apps"" with near-zero JavaScript and fine-grained lazy loading. It is not the world's first O(1) JavaScript framework. This article covers what Qwik is, how it compares to React and Angular, how to make";UI & UX;;;;Ruby Jane Cabagnot
4515;Developer Joy ‚Äì How great teams get s%*t done;INTERMEDIATE;In this talk, Sven will discuss how great software teams measure and improve their developer productivity, coordinate work across teams, run microservice teams, and create a healthy and joyful engineering culture.

We can also discuss the business view and use it as a basis for the next round of management discussions.;Architecture;;;;Anja Kunkel
4913;Keep your dependencies in check;BEGINNER;We need to stay on top of updating our applications, but doing so can take a lot of time. Luckily, there are plenty of tools that can help, from package managers to bots that can create changes on our repositories. We should evaluate these options to find the best solution for our particular situation.;Build & Deploy;;;;Marit van Dijk
